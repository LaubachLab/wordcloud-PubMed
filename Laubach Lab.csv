Here, we review studies on the role of the rat medial prefrontal cortex in adaptive control, with a focus on simple reaction time tasks that can be easily used across species and have clinical relevance. The performance of these tasks is associated with neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex that reflects stimulus detection, action timing, and outcome monitoring. We describe rhythmic neural activity that occurs when animals initiate a temporally extended action. Such rhythmic activity is coterminous with major changes in population spike activity. Testing animals over a series of sessions with varying pre-stimulus intervals showed that the signals adapt to the current temporal demands of the task. Disruptions of rhythmic neural activity occur on error trials (premature responding) and lead to a persistent encoding of the error and a subsequent change in behavioral performance (i.e. post-error slowing). Analysis of simultaneously recorded spike activity suggests that the presence of strong theta rhythms is coterminous with altered network dynamics, and might serve as a mechanism for adaptive control. Computational modeling suggests that these signals may enable learning from errors. Together, our findings contribute to an emerging literature and provide a new perspective on the neuronal mechanisms for the adaptive control of action.","2015-06","2018-07-06 13:20:52","2018-07-06 13:20:52","","104-117","","1-3","109","","J.

Neuronal activity in this area is modulated when rats initiate consummatory licking and reversible inactivations eliminate reward contrast effects and reduce a measure of palatability, the duration of licking bouts. Together, these data suggest the hypothesis that rhythmic neuronal activity in the mPFC is crucial for the control of consummatory behavior. The muscarinic cholinergic system is known to regulate membrane excitability and control low-frequency rhythmic activity in the mPFC. Muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) act through KCNQ (Kv7) potassium channels, which have recently been linked to the orexigenic peptide ghrelin. To understand if drugs that act on KCNQ channels within the mPFC have effects on consummatory behavior, we made infusions of several muscarinic drugs (scopolamine, oxotremorine, physostigmine), the KCNQ channel blocker XE-991, and ghrelin into the mPFC and evaluated their effects on consummatory behavior. A consistent finding across all drugs was an effect on the duration of licking bouts when animals consume solutions with a relatively high concentration of sucrose. The muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced bout durations, both systemically and intra-cortically. By contrast, the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine, the KCNQ channel blocker XE-991, and ghrelin all increased the durations of licking bouts when infused into the mPFC. Our findings suggest that cholinergic and ghrelinergic signaling in the mPFC, acting through KCNQ channels, regulates the expression of palatability.","2015","2018-07-06 13:20:53","2018-07-06 13:20:53","","284","","","9","","Front Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26578914 PMCID: PMC4620145","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578914","","ghrelin; KCNQ; licking; muscarinic; prefrontal; reward","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats were trained in an operant licking procedure in which they received alternating access to solutions with relatively high and low levels of sucrose (20 and 4%, w/v). Each level of sucrose was available for fixed intervals of 30 s over 30 min test sessions. Over several days of training, rats came to lick persistently when the high level of sucrose was available and suppressed licking when the low level of sucrose was available. Pharmacological inactivations of the mPFC, specifically the rostral part of the prelimbic area, greatly reduced intake of the higher value fluid and only slightly increased intake of the lower value fluid. In addition, the inactivations altered within-session patterns and microstructural measures of licking. Rats licked equally for the high and low levels of sucrose at the beginning of the test sessions and ""relearned"" to reduce intake of the low value fluid over the test sessions. Durations of licking bouts (clusters of licks with inter-lick intervals <0.5 s) were reduced for the high value fluid and there were many more brief licking bouts (<1 s) when the low value fluid was available. These effects were verified using an alternative approach (optogenetic silencing using archaerhodopsin) and were distinct from inactivation of the ventral striatum, which simply increased overall intake. Our findings suggest that the mPFC is crucial for the maintenance of persistent licking and the expression of learned feeding strategies.","2015","2018-07-06 13:20:54","2018-07-06 13:20:54","","23","","","9","","Front Integr Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25870544 PMCID: PMC4375994","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870544","","cingulate cortex; learning; muscimol; optogenetics; prefrontal cortex; reward processing; sucrose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Success or failure on the previous trial is often an important factor for determining whether a subject will attempt to time the stimulus or wait for it to occur before initiating action. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in enabling the top-down control of action depending on the outcome of the previous trial. Analysis of spike activity from the rat mPFC suggests that neural integration is a key mechanism for adaptive control in precisely timed tasks. We show through simulation that a spiking neural network consisting of coupled neural integrators captures the neural dynamics of the experimentally recorded mPFC. Errors lead to deviations in the normal dynamics of the system, a process that could enable learning from past mistakes. We expand on this coupled integrator network to construct a spiking neural network that performs a reaction-time task by following either a cue-response or timing strategy, and show that it performs the task with similar reaction times as experimental subjects while maintaining the same spiking dynamics as the experimentally recorded mPFC.","2014-01-29","2018-07-06 13:20:55","2018-07-06 13:20:55","","1892-1902","","5","34","","J.

We demonstrate that after errors, low-frequency oscillations below 12 Hz are modulated over the midfrontal cortex in humans and within the prelimbic and anterior cingulate regions of the MFC in rats. These oscillations were phase locked between the MFC and motor areas in both rats and humans. In rats, single neurons that encoded prior behavioral outcomes were phase coherent with low-frequency field oscillations, particularly after errors. Inactivating the medial frontal regions in rats led to impaired behavioral adjustments after errors, eliminated the differential expression of low-frequency oscillations after errors and increased low-frequency spike-field coupling within the motor cortex.

Here, we examine this issue by analyzing changes in neuronal spike activity and local field potentials in the rat mPFC in relation to the consumption of rewarding stimuli. Using multi-electrode recording methods, we simultaneously recorded from ensembles of neurons and field potentials in the mPFC during the performance of an operant-delayed alternation task and a variable-interval licking procedure. In both tasks, we found that consummatory behavior (licking) activates many mPFC neurons and is associated with theta-band phase locking by mPFC field potentials. Many neurons that were modulated by the delivery of reward were also modulated when rats emitted bouts of licks during the period of consumption. The majority of these licking-modulated neurons were found in the rostral part of the prelimbic cortex, a region that is heavily interconnected with the gustatory insular cortex and projects to subcortical feeding-related centers. Based on the tight coupling between spike activity, theta-band phase locking, and licking behavior, we suggest that reward-related activity in the mPFC is driven by consummatory behavior.","2013","2018-07-06 13:20:57","2018-07-06 13:20:57","","56","","","7","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23596384 PMCID: PMC3622888","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23596384","","feeding; field potential; food; foraging; licking; phase locking; population activity; theta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The functional role of mPFC may change over the lifespan due to a number of aging-related issues, including dendritic regression, increased cAMP signaling, and reductions in the efficacy of neuromodulators to influence mPFC processing. A key neurotransmitter in mPFC is norepinephrine. Previous studies have reported aging-related changes in the sensitivity of mPFC-dependent tasks to noradrenergic agonist drugs, such as guanfacine. Here, we assessed the effects of yohimbine, an alpha-2 noradrenergic antagonist, in cohorts of younger and older rats in a classic test of spatial working memory (using a T-maze). Older rats (23-29 mo.) were impaired by a lower dose of yohimbine compared to younger animals (5-10 mo.). To determine if the drug acts on alpha-2 noradrenergic receptors in mPFC and if its effects are specific to memory-guided performance, we made infusions of yohimbine into mPFC of a cohort of young rats (6 mo.) using an operant delayed response task. The task involved testing rats in blocks of trials with memory- and stimulus-guided performance. Yohimbine selectively impaired memory-guided performance and was associated with error perseveration. Infusions of muscimol (a GABA-A agonist) at the same sites also selectively impaired memory-guided performance, but did not lead to error perseveration. Based on these results, we propose several potential interpretations for the role for the noradrenergic system in the performance of delayed response tasks, including the encoding of previous response locations, task rules (i.e., using a win-stay strategy instead of a win-shift strategy), and performance monitoring (e.g., prospective encoding of outcomes).","2012","2018-07-06 13:20:58","2018-07-06 13:20:58","","125","","","6","","Front Integr Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23293590 PMCID: PMC3534184","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23293590","","aging; behavioral flexibility; cognitive control; muscimol; noradrenaline; prefrontal cortex; working memory; yohimbine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PFC guides behaviour and thought using working memory, which are essential functions in the information age. Many PFC neurons hold information in working memory through excitatory networks that can maintain persistent neuronal firing in the absence of external stimulation. This fragile process is highly dependent on the neurochemical environment. For example, elevated cyclic-AMP signalling reduces persistent firing by opening HCN and KCNQ potassium channels. It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal ageing alter the physiological properties of PFC neurons during working memory, as there have been no in vivo recordings, to our knowledge, from PFC neurons of aged monkeys. Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing a marked loss of PFC persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by restoring an optimal neurochemical environment. Recordings showed an age-related decline in the firing rate of DELAY neurons, whereas the firing of CUE neurons remained unchanged with age. The memory-related firing of aged DELAY neurons was partially restored to more youthful levels by inhibiting cAMP signalling, or by blocking HCN or KCNQ channels. These findings reveal the cellular basis of age-related cognitive decline in dorsolateral PFC, and demonstrate that physiological integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of PFC circuits.","2011-07-27","2018-07-06 13:20:59","2018-07-06 13:20:59","","210-213","","7359","476","","Nature","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21796118 PMCID: PMC3193794","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796118","","Action Potentials; Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; Aging; Animals; Biomedical Enhancement; Cues; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels; Guanfacine; Humans; Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels; KCNQ Potassium Channels; Macaca mulatta; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Potassium Channel Blockers; Potassium Channels; Prefrontal Cortex; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sensitivities of neurons to choice, outcome, and temporal information-related aspects of the task were examined. About one-third of neurons were sensitive to the location of delayed responding while animals were at one of two spatially distinct response ports. However, many fewer neurons (<10%) maintained choice information over the delay, each exhibiting persistent differences in firing rates for only a portion of the delay. Another third of cells encoded information about behavioral outcomes, and some of these neurons (>20% of all cells) fired at distinct rates in advance of correct and incorrect responses (i.e., prospective encoding of outcome). Other cells were sensitive to reward-related feedback stimuli (>20%), the outcome of the preceding trial (retrospective encoding, 5-10%), and/or the time since a trial was last performed (10-20%). An anatomical analysis of the recording sites found that cells that were sensitive to choice, temporal, and outcome information were commingled within the middle layers of the mPFC. Together, our results suggest that spatial processing is only part of what drives mPFC neurons to become active during spatial working memory tasks. We propose that the primary role of mPFC in these tasks is to monitor behavioral performance by encoding information about recent trial outcomes to guide expectations and responses on the current trial. By encoding these variables, the mPFC is able to exert control over action and ensure that tasks are performed effectively and efficiently.","2012-12","2018-07-06 13:20:59","2018-07-06 13:20:59","","3276-3288","","12","108","","J.

In this study, we show that administration of nicotine during mouse perinatal development can impair performance in an auditory discrimination paradigm when the exposed animals are mature. This suggests that nicotine disrupts auditory pathways via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that are expressed at an early stage of development. We have also determined that mice which lack nAChRs containing the β2 subunit (β2* nAChRs) exhibit similarly compromised performance in this task, suggesting that β2* nAChRs are necessary for normal auditory discrimination or that β2* nAChRs play a critical role in development of the circuitry required for task performance. In contrast, no effect of perinatal nicotine exposure or β2 subunit knockout was found on the acquisition and performance of a differential reinforcement of low rate task. This suggests that the auditory discrimination impairments are not a consequence of a general deficit in learning and memory, but may be the result of compromised auditory stimulus processing in the nicotine-exposed and knockout animals.","2012-05-16","2018-07-06 13:21:01","2018-07-06 13:21:01","","170-180","","1","231","","Behav.

Recently, statistical pattern recognition methods, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), have emerged as a standard approach for examining neural codes. These methods work well when data sets are over-determined (i.e., there are more observations than predictor variables). But this is not always the case in many experimental data sets. One way to reduce the number of predictor variables is to preprocess data prior to classification. Here, a wavelet-based method is described for preprocessing spike trains. The method is based on the discriminant pursuit (DP) algorithm of Buckheit and Donoho [Proc. SPIE 2569 (1995) 540-51]. DP extracts a reduced set of features that are well localized in the time and frequency domains and that can be subsequently analyzed with statistical classifiers. DP is illustrated using neuronal spike trains recorded in the motor cortex of an awake, behaving rat [Laubach et al. Nature 405 (2000) 567-71]. In addition, simulated spike trains that differed only in the timing of spikes are used to show that DP outperforms another method for preprocessing spike trains, principal component analysis (PCA) [Richmond and Optican J.

However, the neural circuits that allow mPFC to influence activity in the motor system have remained unclear. In the present study, we used a combination of tract-tracing and reversible inactivation methods to examine the role of a motor-related area in the rat frontal cortex, called the rostral forelimb area (RFA), in the top-down control of action. Neural tracing studies involved used electrical microstimulation to identify RFA and injections of biotinylated dextran amines (BDA) to map out connections of RFA with other parts of the frontal cortex. Connections were found between RFA and mPFC, the agranular insular cortex, and the primary motor cortex. Reversible inactivations using muscimol infusions into RFA increased response times and eliminated delay-dependent speeding, but did not increase premature responding. These results are markedly different from what is obtained when muscimol is infused into mPFC, which leads to excessive premature responding and a reduction of RTs to stimuli at short delays (Narayanan et al., 2006). We also tested animals during the RT task after inactivating the agranular insular cortex, which contains neurons that projects to and receives from RFA and mPFC, and found no effects on RT performance. Together, these studies suggest that RFA is a premotor region in the rat frontal cortex that competes with mPFC to control action selection. We suggest that RFA controls the threshold that is used to initiate responding and generates prepotent excitation over responding that is crucial for temporal preparation.","2010","2018-07-06 13:21:03","2018-07-06 13:21:03","","124","","","4","","Front Integr Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21031033 PMCID: PMC2965050","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21031033","","executive control; frontal cortex; muscimol; reaction time; sensorimotor; tract tracing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AcbSh contains high levels of receptor for melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a lateral hypothalamic peptide critical for feeding and metabolism. MCH receptor (MCHR1) activation in the AcbSh increases food intake, while AcbSh MCHR1 blockade reduces feeding. Here biochemical and cellular mechanisms of MCH action in the rodent AcbSh are described. A reduction of phosphorylation of GluR1 at serine 845 (pSer(845)) is shown to occur after both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of MCHR1 activity. These changes depend upon signaling through G(i/o), and result in decreased surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Electrophysiological analysis of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the AcbSh revealed decreased amplitude of AMPAR-mediated synaptic events (mEPSCs) with MCH treatment. In addition, MCH suppressed action potential firing MSNs through K(+) channel activation. Finally, in vivo recordings confirmed that MCH reduces neuronal cell firing in the AcbSh in freely moving animals. The ability of MCH to reduce cell firing in the AcbSh is consistent with a general model from other pharmacological and electrophysiological studies whereby reduced AcbSh neuronal firing leads to food intake. The current work integrates the hypothalamus into this model, providing biochemical and cellular mechanisms whereby metabolic and limbic signals converge to regulate food intake.","2010-06-16","2018-07-06 13:21:05","2018-07-06 13:21:05","","8263-8273","","24","30","","J.

The task involved making head entries into a response port followed by movements to collect rewards at an adjacent reward port. The availability of sucrose reward was signaled by an acoustic stimulus. During training, animals showed increased rates of responding and came to move rapidly and selectively, following the stimulus, from the response port to the reward port. Behavioral ""devaluation"" studies, pairing sucrose with lithium chloride, established that entries into the response port were habitual (insensitive to devaluation of sucrose) from early in training and entries into the reward port remained goal-directed (sensitive to devaluation) throughout training. Learning-related changes in behavior were paralleled by changes in neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum, with an increasing number of neurons showing task-related firing over the training period. Throughout training, we observed more task-related neurons in the lateral striatum compared with those in the medial striatum. Many of these neurons fired at higher rates during initiation of movements in the presence of the stimulus, compared with similar movements in the absence of the stimulus. Learning was also accompanied by progressive increases in movement-related potentials and transiently increased theta-band oscillations (5-8 Hz) in simultaneously recorded field potentials. Together, these data suggest that representations of task-relevant stimuli and movements develop in the dorsal striatum during instrumental learning.","2009-07","2018-07-06 13:21:06","2018-07-06 13:21:06","","475-489","","1","102","","J.

Principal component analysis was used to identify major patterns of delay-related activity in frontal cortex: ramping activity and sustained delay activity. These patterns were similar in dmPFC and motor cortex and did not change as animals learned to respond at novel delays. Many neurons in both areas were modulated early in the delay period. Other neurons were modulated in a persistent manner over the duration of the delay period. Delay-related modulations started earlier in motor cortex than in dmPFC and terminated around different task events (at the time of release in dmPFC, just before release of the lever in motor cortex). A subpopulation of neurons was found in dmPFC, but not motor cortex, that fired in response to the trigger stimulus.

Here, we describe how neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum changes during the initial acquisition of a Go/NoGo task and during an initial reversal of stimulus-response contingencies. Rats made nosepoke responses over delay periods and then received one of two acoustic stimuli. Liquid rewards were delivered after one stimulus (S+) if the rats made a Go response (entering a reward port on the opposite wall of the chamber). If a Go response was made to other stimulus (S-), rats experienced a timeout. On 10% of trials, no stimulus was presented. These trials were used to assess response bias, the animals' tendency to collect reward independent of the stimulus. Response bias increased during the reversal, corresponding to the animals' uncertainty about the stimulus-response contingencies. Most task-modulated neurons fired during the response at the end of the delay period. The fraction of response-modulated neurons was correlated with response bias and neural activity was sensitive to the behavioral response made on the previous trial. During initial task acquisition and initial reversal learning, there was a remarkable change in the percentages of neurons that fired in relation to the task events, especially during withdrawal from the nosepoke aperture. These results suggest that changes in task-related activity in the dorsomedial striatum during learning are driven by the animal's bias to collect rewards.","2009-11-25","2018-07-06 13:21:09","2018-07-06 13:21:09","","14891-14902","","47","29","","J.

This effect could be due to impairments in attending to trigger stimuli, estimating the timing of trigger stimuli, or inhibitory control of the motor response. Here, we examined these issues by reversibly inactivating dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during simple reaction time tasks with variable or fixed foreperiods. There were three consistent effects of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex inactivation: 1) increased premature responding, 2) increased variability in the timing of premature responses, and 3) speeded response latencies, especially on trials with short foreperiods in tasks with variable foreperiods. We observed these effects independent of differences in foreperiod duration, foreperiod variability, and stimulus probabilities. Therefore, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex appears not to be involved in attending to the trigger stimulus or in time estimation. Instead, we suggest that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is critical for inhibiting responses before the maximum foreperiod duration, i.e. the ""deadline"" [Ollman RT, Billington MJ (1972) The deadline model for simple reaction times.

Interpretations of the effects of muscimol infusions into the brain have been limited because of uncertainty about spread of the drug around the injection site. To solve this problem, the present study explored the use of a fluorophore-conjugated muscimol molecule (FCM). Whole-cell recordings from horizontal brain slices demonstrated that bath-applied FCM acts like muscimol in reversibly suppressing excitatory synaptic transmission. Two types of in vivo experiments demonstrated that the behavioral effects of FCM infusion are similar to the behavioral effects of muscimol infusion. FCM infusion into the rat amygdala before fear conditioning impaired both cued and contextual freezing, which were tested 24 or 48 h later. Normal fear conditioning occurred when these same rats were subsequently given phosphate-buffered saline infusions. FCM infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex impaired accuracy during a delayed-response task. Histological analysis showed that the region of fluorescence was restricted to 0.5-1mm from the injection site. Myelinated fiber tracts acted as diffusional barriers, thereby shaping the overall spread of fluorescence. The results suggest that FCM is indeed useful for exploring the function of small brain regions.","2008-06-15","2018-07-06 13:21:13","2018-07-06 13:21:13","","30-38","","1","171","","J. Neurosci.

To understand this result, we applied a framework for quantifying statistical relationships between neurons (Schneidman et al., 2003) to all possible combinations of neurons within our ensembles. We found that almost all neurons (96%) contributed redundant predictive information to the ensembles. This redundancy resulted in the maintenance of predictive information despite the removal of many neurons from each ensemble. Moreover, the balance of synergistic and redundant interactions depended on the number of neurons in the ensemble. Small ensembles could exhibit synergistic interactions (e.g., 23 +/- 9% of ensembles with two neurons were synergistic). In contrast, larger ensembles exhibited mostly redundant interactions (e.g., 99 +/- 0.1% of ensembles with eight neurons were redundant).

The method is shown to account for the relationship between the spike train of a given neuron, the activity of other neurons that are recorded simultaneously, and a variety of time-varying features of acoustic stimuli, e.g. spectral content, amplitude, and sound source direction. Vocalization-evoked neuronal responses from the marmoset auditory cortex are used to illustrate the method. Optimal predictions of single-unit activity were obtained by using the recent-time history of the target neuron and the concurrent activity of other simultaneously recorded neurons (R: 0.82 +/- 0.01, approximately 67% of variance). Predictions based on ensemble activity alone (R: 0.63 +/- 0.18) were equivalent to those based on the combination of ensemble activity and spectral features of the vocal calls (R: 0.61 +/- 0.24). This result suggests that all information derived from the spectrogram is embodied in ensemble activity and that there is a high level of redundancy in the marmoset auditory cortex. We also illustrate that the method allows for quantification of relative and shared contributions of each variable (spike train, spectral feature) to predictions of neuronal activity and describe a novel ""neurolet"" transform that arises from the method and that may serve as a tool for computationally efficient processing of natural sounds.","2004-06-15","2018-07-06 13:21:19","2018-07-06 13:21:19","","77-85","","1","136","","J.

The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex (MFC), a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multielectrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher- and lower-value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 s periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher-value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower-value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats' lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 s added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent MFC, is synchronized to rewarded actions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex (MFC) have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.","2017-11-01","2018-07-06 13:21:20","2018-07-06 13:21:20","","10757-10769","","44","37","","J.
